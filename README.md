# Reden is What We Made

Redstone EDEN

**English** | [简体中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

## Planned Features

- [ ] RVC, Redstone Version Control, machine history and diff analysis
- [ ] RVCHub, a universal machine sharing platform, and automatic recognition of whether the machine has been correctly marked with copyright
- [ ] RVCSign, sign your machine, a simple step to ensure that your machine is not tampered with or forged
- [ ] Micro-timing analysis and simulation: block update breakpoints (NC, PP, CU, BE), BED debugger, step-by-step update, step-by-step tick, update reset
- [x] Ctrl+Z immediately undo the previous operation, machine development no longer needs to be backed up! (Waiting for more testing)
- [ ] Automated unit testing of machines, divide your machine into modules and test them independently to ensure that each module runs correctly

## Original Intention

Provide a one-stop working environment for redstone machine developers and become the best redstone debugging and teaching tool.
